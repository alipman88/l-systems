[L-Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) are a type of formal grammar which uses recursively-applied character substitution rules to produce strings that can then be translated into fractal images via turtle graphics.

I created this project to brush up on ReactJS and D3.js - view the work in progress here: **[lsystem88.herokuapp.com](https://lsystem88.herokuapp.com/)**
